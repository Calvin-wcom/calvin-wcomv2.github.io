## Intelligent Sensing and Communication for Future Smart Radio
Along with the constantly emerging applications of communications, such as extended reality (XR), wearable devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
etc., data traffic is undergoing an explosive growth phase. To address these challenges, there is an emerging need to integrate machine learning technologies into designing, planning, and optimizing future wireless communications. According to the line of thought of “sensing-transmission-service”, this project focuses on the key technologies for intelligent communications to facilitate the road to smart radio environments. 

### Topic 1: Smart Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio 
- Description of AI applications in networking.  

### Topic 2: Machine Learning for Signal Processing
- Explain how ML improves signal processing.
